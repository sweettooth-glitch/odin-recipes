    <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
    <p>A warm and comforting dish that tastes even better the next day. Preperation may seem extensive and ingredients could go on forever, but its only because a good minestrone soup is endlessly variable. Use some of the ingredients or all of them, the key here is to include the essential flavour profiles and to give it time.</p>
    <p>An addition not included on the ingredient list but which most definately wouldnt hurt? Anchovies. Trust me. Just chop finely and add them at at saut√® stage - they wont dominate the soup but rather, add a delicious umami finish. Serve with warm bread or garlic croutons </p>
